Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool designed to help users create dynamic interactive data visualizations and help you monitor data, analyze trends, and make smarter decisions. Before you can create any visuals though, you need to get your data into Power BI to use in the modeling process. In this course, Helen Wall helps you handle, import, and transform your data more efficiently, using the built-in power of Power Query. Helen shows you how to create ETL frameworks and use Power Query to extract data from multiple data sources, transform it through functionalities like grouping and pivoting, and load it into the Power BI model.
